Fraud Detection Project

Project Overview
This project focuses on fraud detection using advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques. The goal was to identify patterns and trends in transactional data, develop predictive models, and create insightful visualizations through interactive dashboards. The dashboards were designed to provide actionable insights to detect and prevent fraudulent activities.

Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted in-depth data analysis to uncover hidden patterns and relationships.
Machine Learning Models: Trained and evaluated models to predict fraudulent transactions, including:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
XGBoost
Data Visualization: Developed dashboards using Power BI to showcase transaction trends, fraud patterns, and high-risk areas.

Technologies Used
Data Processing: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
Visualization: Power BI
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
Data Source: Synthetic data for visualization purposes
Dataset Platform: Kaggle

Project Highlights
Implemented machine learning models to classify fraudulent transactions with high accuracy.
Created feature-rich Power BI dashboards that provide:
Fraud Analysis: Trends and patterns in fraudulent transactions.
Transaction Summary: Interactive views of total transactions and fraud rates.
Customer Insights: Demographics and high-risk profiles.
Designed the data visualization layer to simulate real-world applications and demonstrate expertise in BI tools.
Visualizations
Fraud Trends Dashboard: Highlights transaction patterns over time, including fraudulent activity distributions.
Customer Insights Dashboard: Focused on high-risk profiles and demographic trends.

Screenshots of the dashboards are included in the snapshots folder.
